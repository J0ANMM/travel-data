# travel-data

The data provided in this repository was gathered under the scope of the development of [Travelinho](https://www.travelinho.com)'s search engine.

The search engine has been discontinued, so the data is not maintained anymore. Therefore, there might be instances that are out-of-date. 

There was a lot of manual effort to gather all the data, so hopefully, even if it is not updated, this might be now useful to somebody else.
